# Polynomial-Regression

Overview
This project implements a Polynomial Regression model to predict outcomes based on polynomial features. Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.

In this project, we explore the use of polynomial regression on a dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance. The model uses scikit-learn for machine learning, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
